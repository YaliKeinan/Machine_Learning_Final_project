# Overview
This project addressed a binary classification problem aimed at predicting whether a candidate would be hired based on various features. We used CSV files for training and testing. The process included data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation and predictions on unseen test data.
This project was conducted as part of my studies in the Digital Sciences for High-Tech program at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Engineering. It served as the final project in a machine learning course, where we applied various machine learning techniques for classification and prediction.

The dataset we worked with consisted of 55,462 rows, each representing an individual candidate. After testing different approaches, we selected a model that achieved an impressive AUC score of 0.97 on the test set.
This project provided deep insights into data handling, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, as well as deployment of machine learning models.

The entire project, including the code and detailed explanations, is documented in a Python-Markdown Jupyter Notebook.
